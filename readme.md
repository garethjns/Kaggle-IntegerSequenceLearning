# Kaggle Integer Sequence Learning
Data and description: <https://www.kaggle.com/c/integer-sequence-learning>

Objective: Predict the next value in integer sequences from the [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](http://oeis.org/).

Current position: 16/269 (top 6%)


This Kaggle competition is unusual as each sequence in the dataset presents an independent problem to solve. Some of the sequences can be solved directly, some can be estimated using various machine learning methods. 

**classifyingSequences.ipynb** - Notebook proposing automatic classification of basic properties of sequences, which can be used to guide which approaches are more likely to work for a sequence.

Main code to be added.
